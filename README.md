## üåü Overview

This project presents an Arduino-based non-invasive continuous glucose monitor (CGM) prototype designed for measuring blood glucose levels without needles or invasive procedures. It utilizes near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with temperature correction to provide reasonably accurate glucose estimations. The system aims to provide an affordable and accessible alternative to traditional invasive glucose monitoring methods.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Non-Invasive Measurement**: Uses optical sensing rather than needles or blood samples
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous measurement of glucose levels
- **Temperature Compensation**: Accounts for variations in skin temperature to improve accuracy
- **Calibration System**: Allows for personalized calibration to improve measurement accuracy
- **Rolling Average Filtering**: Reduces noise and stabilizes readings
- **Compact Design**: Built with readily available, low-cost components
- **Serial Output**: Provides detailed output for monitoring and data logging
- **Range Constraining**: Ensures readings fall within physiologically relevant values

## üî¨ Scientific Principles

The prototype works on the principle of Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy:

1. **Optical Absorption**: Different glucose concentrations in blood absorb NIR light differently
2. **Beer-Lambert Law**: The amount of light absorbed is proportional to the concentration of glucose
3. **Temperature Compensation**: Skin temperature affects measurements and is compensated for using a temperature coefficient
4. **Linear Interpolation**: Translates optical readings to glucose concentration using calibration points

## üõ†Ô∏è Components Required

- Arduino board (UNO or similar)
- IR LED (940nm wavelength)
- Photodiode or phototransistor
- DS18B20 temperature sensor (waterproof version)
- 4.7kŒ© resistor (for temperature sensor)
- Appropriate resistors for LED circuit
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- 3D printed or custom housing for sensor placement

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Optical Measurement**: The IR LED emits light that passes through tissue, and the photodiode measures the amount of light absorbed/reflected
2. **Temperature Monitoring**: The DS18B20 sensor measures skin temperature at the measurement site
3. **Signal Processing**:
   - Multiple readings are taken and averaged to reduce noise
   - Temperature compensation is applied to account for variations in skin temperature
4. **Glucose Calculation**: 
   - Linear interpolation between calibration points converts optical readings to glucose values
   - Range constraints ensure physiologically relevant outputs

## üìä Calibration Process

The device requires calibration with reference glucose values:

1. Collect optical readings at different known glucose levels (preferably using a traditional glucometer)
2. Define the relationship between optical readings and glucose values
3. Set the coefficients in the code (`optical_low_calibrated`, `optical_high_calibrated`, etc.)
4. Adjust temperature coefficient (`temp_coeff_mgdl_per_C`) based on observed temperature dependencies

## üöÄ Future Improvements

- Implement machine learning algorithms for better calibration and accuracy
- Add wireless connectivity (Bluetooth/WiFi) for data transmission to smartphone apps
- Improve form factor and ergonomics for better user experience
- Incorporate multiple wavelength measurements for improved specificity
- Develop companion app for data logging and trend analysis
- Add alerting mechanisms for hypo/hyperglycemic conditions

## üìù Usage

1. **Setup**:
   - Connect the components according to the circuit diagram
   - Upload the provided Arduino code
   - Ensure the sensor is positioned correctly on the measurement site

2. **Calibration**:
   - Take multiple readings with a reference glucose meter
   - Adjust the calibration constants in the code
   - Re-upload the code with your personal calibration values

3. **Monitoring**:
   - The device will output readings to the Serial Monitor
   - Format: `Avg Optical: [value], Raw Optical: [value], Temperature: [value] C, Est. Glucose: [value] mg/dL`
   - Monitor trends rather than absolute values for best results
